**Problem Statement:** Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioural data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The data set used: banking

**Key features:**
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it was ready for model training.

- Model Building: Built a decision tree classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm for classification tasks.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure its predictive accuracy.
